%% Adaptive Noise Cancellation Using RLS Adaptive Filtering
% This example shows how to use an RLS filter to extract useful
% information from a noisy signal.  The information bearing signal is a
% sine wave that is corrupted by additive white gaussian noise.
%
% The adaptive noise cancellation system assumes the use of two
% microphones.  A primary microphone picks up the noisy input signal, while
% a secondary microphone receives noise that is uncorrelated to the
% information bearing signal, but is correlated to the noise picked up by
% the primary microphone.
%
% Note: This example is equivalent to the Simulink(R) model 'rlsdemo'
% provided.
